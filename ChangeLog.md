### Optifine Spawning Fix

Fixes the bug of Optifine that mob spawning is suppressed when a player has just joined the world, or that mob spawning continues when a player has just swapped to spectator mode, before the player moves across chunks.

This is unnecessary in liteloaded vanilla without Optifine.
